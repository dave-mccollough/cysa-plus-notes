# Security Control Catagories

- Security Control
    - Mitigates vulnerabilities and risk to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability and authentication of data
    - Security controls should be selected and deployed in a structured manner using a risk management framework
        - ISO 27001
        - NIST Special Publication 800-53
            - Catagories
                - AC - Access Control
                - AA - Accountability
                - IR - Incident Response
                - RM - Risk Management
            - Controls
                - Technical (Logical) Control   
                    - Category of security control that is implemented as a system (hardware, software, or firmware)
                - Operational Control
                    - Category of security control that is implemented by people rather than systems
                - Managerial Control
                    - Category of control that provides oversight of an information system
            **NOTE**
                - Newer versions of NIST SP 800-83 do not use classes of controls any longer
                - These are still used by CySA+

- Functional Types
    - Preventative
        - Control that acts to eliminate or reduce the likelihood that an attack will succeed
    - Detective Control
        - A control that may not prevent or deter access, but will identitfy and record any attempted or sucessful intrusion
    - Corrective Control
        - Control that acts to eliminate or reduce the impact of an intrusion event
    - Physical Control
        - Control that acts against in-person intrusion attempts
    - Deterrent Control
        - Control that discourages intrusion attempts
    - Compensating Control
        - Control that acts as a substitute for a principal control
    - Responsive Control
        - Control that actively monitors for potential vulnerabilites or attacks, then takes action to mitigate before they can cause damage


- Control efficiency is measured by how long it delays an attack
- The longer it can delay an attack, the more effective it will be for our organization
